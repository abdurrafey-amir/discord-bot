# Basic Discord Bot

just a basic discord bot in python. it just has text commands now. i'll do slash commands after this.

You can add the bot to your server using this link [SpongeBot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1265596503016341506&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot). The default prefix is `!`. get started by using `!help`.
